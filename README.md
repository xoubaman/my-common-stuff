# My common stuff

Repository with all the crap I would like to have consistently across the computers
I use for development.

Just a bunch of dotfiles so far.

Heavily *inspired* by the [dotfiles](https://github.com/agjacome/dotfiles) repository
of the great [agjacome](https://github.com/agjacome).

The `install.sh` script will copy the files from the repository folder to the
system. This means it will replace the files, so be careful if for some reason
you are using this repository and you are not me.


The `update.sh` script will update the repository files with the ones in the
system.

Files updated are the ones in the `file-list.sh` relative to home folder.

It assumes oh-my-zsh installed.
